      "OLD TEXT:  Heavy Duty Fruity seems to have everything going for it: high yields, yummy flavor, and potency. T. H. Seeds bred this West Coast native from local (and locally named) favorites Killing Garberville, Seattle Big Bud, and Mendocino Hash Plant to create a multi-skilled strain. Growers should be aware that plants do not always have classic seven-point leaves, but her unique beauty does not affect her output. Heavy Duty Fruity also gives off a heavy duty sweet smell, so it may require management for indoor growers. What is not a concern is yield and bud size, both of which are consistently large with this strain, both indoors and out. Plants usually flower between 8 and 9 weeks. Depending on when this plant is harvested, her effects range from psychedelic and spacey to mellow relaxation.\n",
